This repo is a WIP recreation of the Still Alive scene from the ending credits of Portal.
Run "stillalive.java" in a Terminal / Command line that supports ANSI.

This is a work in progress, and the melody and full lyrics are not done.

Eventually I might get around to converting it to C++

Also, ensure the text all fits in your terminal. if its too small, the ANSI code to go back doesn't seem to work when it reaches the top. if, after it is run, both the top and bottom lines are mostly repeated dashes, its the right size
Personally, on my windows laptop, full screen terminal on 9 pt font seems to work fine, but play around for the right size!
